# About
Funter is made as a final assignment for my mobile development course. The idea is that people can battle each other by doing a scavenger hunt in the forests. 
Taking items away would harm the nature, so taking pictures prevents this. Made with React Native.

Uses the Expo library to use the phones hardware, so `npm install` is required.

## Future
I don't think i will be continuing with this project in 2021. At the moment i have no interest of developing on mobile and expanding my skillset to mobile only. 
Most of the web apps are also available on mobile and i prefer learning about PWA to give a app like feel to website. However, it is overall quite interesting, so i will continue with it eventually, just not any time soon.
